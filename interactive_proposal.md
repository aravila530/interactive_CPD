Data:
I would like to look into Chicago Police Department Investigatory Stop Reports (ISR). I have gotten data from the Chicago Police Department website (https://www.chicagopolice.org/statistics-data/isr-data/). This goes from year 2016 to 2023. This dataset shows documented police interactions during investigatory stops. It includes details about the stop location, and time, along with descriptive information about suspects (e.g., age, race, physical attributes), gang affiliations, and narcotics indicators. Vehicle information and any discovered contraband (e.g., weapons, drugs) are also recorded. It also captures specific actions taken during the stop, such as arrests or pat-downs. 

Interactive Visualizations: 
- https://www.opencellid.org/#zoom=17&lat=37.780319&lon=-122.41794
    - When I look at this visualization I think about a map of Chicago seperated in different neighborhoods/distracts/wards. I would like to be able to click and zoom into the specific place to see the exact locations of the stops. I think I would add two different colors to distinguish between an 'Investigatory Stop' (INVSTG) or a 'Gang and Narcotics-Related Loitering' (GANGLTR). I would also like to change throughout the years though. I believe this approach as this would be more of a Dynamic Ensemble with a couple other visualizations adding to it.

    - I would like to incorperate the figure of decending time if possible. I think it would be interesting to see how different neighborhoods changed their stop percentages as time went on, more specifically with the mayor changes in 2019 and 2023.  This would be a dynamic ensemble that compliments the figure talked about above.

    - The data I have includes gang related information. I would like to add this visualization showing each neighborhood and the different gangs that were involed in. Or possibly see the types of things (i.e. drugs, weapons, ect.) that came out of the search conducted. This would be a dynamic ensemble.

Questions: 
- Is this too much to take on? Or should I explore a Core Interactive with the first option I have but maybe expanding it a little more with adding other pieces of information?
