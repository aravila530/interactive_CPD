            This interactive map visualizes investigatory and gang-related stops conducted
            by the Chicago Police Department from 2016 to 2023. The map allows users to explore trends 
            and patterns in police stops across Chicago's districts over time. Use the year slider to examine 
            how stops evolved during different time periods and under varying political leadership.

            Key changes in Chicago's leadership during this period:
              <li><strong>Rahm Emanuel (2011–2019):</strong> Policies during Emanuel's tenure included 
              heightened police oversight following high-profile incidents and attention to police accountability.</li>
              <li><strong>Lori Lightfoot (2019–2023):</strong> Lightfoot's term emphasized police reform, 
              community engagement, and budget reallocations aimed to address systemic inequities.</li>
              <li><strong>Brandon Johnson (2023–present):</strong> Johnson's focus includes reshaping public safety initiatives 
              and investing in alternative approaches to community well-being.</li>
          </p>

            Use the buttons to switch between investigatory and gang-related stops, and explore the relationship between policing 
            strategies and changes in mayoral leadership or policies. This tool highlights how public safety practices have adapted 
            over time, providing insights into broader socio-political trends in Chicago.
